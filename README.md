## Milestones
* Lvl-800 ➡️ Complete to 200 (by: 28 Feb 25)
* Lvl-1200 ➡️ Complete to 25 (by: 28 Feb 25)

## Todo
1. add helper modules: 
   - add documentation to legacy file(that which are transferred from local) - web crawl codeForce 
2. Add documentation sheet to record learnings, approaches and knowledge dumps

## Learnings
* before you type, draw the approach. go top down. get a rough outline down
* then make change, iterate to polish & fine tune the sketch until a michelangelo is achieved
* at this point the high level and low level steps must be specified
* then comes the implementation;decide on the functions, data types and helpers to use. then use them
* then comes the optimization
