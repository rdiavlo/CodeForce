# Learnings

## Approach:

* remember, remember! first understand the problem. each single detail at the god level.
* make a pseudocode, draw the approach. start with the top level; then bottom level
  * identify corner cases
* then populate code with step sections; fill in the sections with a top level outline
* then fill in the lower levels. decide on the functions, data types and helpers to use. then use them
    * define the presentation of output and validators at the end of each step (check at runtime)
* then comes the optimization. iterate to polish & fine tune the sketch until a michelangelo is achieved

> it is 80% approach & 20% implementation skills <br>

## Notes

* get a feel for approach; sit still and think it through & THROUGH
* put pen to paper; until you can speck it in english
* have confidence in the result; leave no corner case open
